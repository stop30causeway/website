You must submit your objections by **Jan 31st**. These can be sent by email or post.
 
You will need to submit _two_ letters - in your own words - one for each of the planning applications.

The number of objections is critical to get Runnymede Borough Council's planning committee to take notice and _every member of the household can submit separate objections._

Objections **can only be made against specific criteria which we have listed below.** Please read and state them in your own words. Further details on all the points can be found in our information leaflet which can be downloaded [here](/assets/stop-30-causeway-flyer.pdf) 


**Design and siting of the buildings**

Visual impact on local area & impact on character of the area, Overlooking/loss of privacy/visual harm/shadowing, Layout and siting of buildings, External design and appearance

**Developing in flood zone 3**

River Flooding, Building in Flood Zones, Groundwater Flooding

**Infrastructure impact on the road network**

Parking, Traffic

**Habitat**

 Ecology impact, Environmental effects

**Failure to Consult**

Lack of real consultation with local residents


Much more detail about all of these points, and a guide to how you can be found in our information leaflet which can be downloaded [here](/assets/stop-30-causeway-flyer.pdf) 

Remember:
- Objections can only be made against these specific criteria
- Two applications so two letters can be submitted (one per application)
- Include your name and address in your letters (these will remain private)
- Letters can be emailed to  planning@runnymede.gov.uk or sent by post to Runnymede Borough Council (RBC), Civic Centre, Station Road,
Addlestone, Surrey KT15 2AH *before 31st January.*
- Encourage other members of your household, neighbours and local friends to submit separate letters (the more individual objection the better)
